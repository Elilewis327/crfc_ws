# Calvin CRFC 2021

# Commands
1. Publish 1 time message to test micro_ros subscriber

```ros2 topic pub --once /micro_ros_arduino_subscriber drive_controller_msgs/msg/Tank '{header: {stamp: {sec: 1, nanosec: 500}, frame_id: base_link}, left: 1.0, right: -1.0}'```

2. Start micro ros agent

```ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyACM0```

This template will get you set up using ROS2 with VSCode as your IDE.

See [how I develop with vscode and ros2](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_docker_ros2.html) for a more in-depth look on how to use this workspace.

## Linux vs. WSL Updates
1. Linux: Go to .devcontainer/devcontainer.json, uncomment 3 Linux labeled lines, and comment out WSL line
2. WSL: enter terminal command: ./scripts/wsl_display_setup.sh (check using: echo $DISPLAY)
3. Launch Dev Container
4. Test graphical forwarding by entering terminal command: rqt (rqt window should pop up, otherwise an error if setup wrong)

### Style

ROS2-approved formatters are included in the IDE.  

* **c++** uncrustify; config from `ament_uncrustify`
* **python** autopep8; vscode settings consistent with the [style guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions/)

### Tasks

There are many pre-defined tasks, see [`.vscode/tasks.json`](.vscode/tasks.json) for a complete listing.  Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.  

Take a look at [how I develop using tasks](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_tasks.html) for an idea on how I use tasks in my development.

### Debugging

This template sets up debugging for python files and gdb for cpp programs.  See [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) for configuration details.

### Continuous Integration

The template also comes with basic continuous integration set up. See [`.github/workflows/ros.yaml`](/.github/workflows/ros.yaml).  

To remove a linter just delete it's name from this line:

```yaml
      matrix:
          linter: [cppcheck, cpplint, uncrustify, lint_cmake, xmllint, flake8, pep257]
```

## How to use this template

### Prerequisites

You should already have Docker and VSCode with the remote containers plugin installed on your system.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [vscode remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Open it in vscode

Now that you've cloned your repo onto your computer, you can open it in VSCode (File->Open Folder). 

When you open it for the first time, you should see a little popup that asks you if you would like to open it in a container.  Say yes!

If you don't see the pop-up, click on the little green square in the bottom left corner, which should bring up the container dialog

In the dialog, select "Remote Containers: Reopen in container"

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"
